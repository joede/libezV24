	Release 0.1.1
	
	* ezV24.c: (v24CountPorts) forgotten to set the local counter
	`count' to 0. So the functions report the number of serial ports
	-1!
	(v24OpenPort): In the case the user want's to wait for DCD on
	open, but don't want NONBLOCKING reads, we have to reset the
	O_NDELAY flag after the open call.

	* Makefile: set patchlevel to 1; I've append a _s to the name of
	the static library; test-v24 is now build immediately with the
	static library.

	* test-v24.c (main): add new commandline option -b to enable
	V24_NO_BLOCK.
